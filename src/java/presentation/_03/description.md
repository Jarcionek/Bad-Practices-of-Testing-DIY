FizzBuzz is the most basic and at the same time the most challenging exercise given to developers. The function is supposed to take a number and return "fizz" if number is divisible by 3, "buzz" if number is divisible by 5, "fizzbuzz" if number is divisible by both 3 and 5 and finally if parameter is not divisible by 3 or 5, the function is supposed to return a number itself. Here is a unit test testing this function named ```fizzBuzz```.

In a browser game there are weapons whose damage and accuracy are different depending on the range. Each weapon is described by three parameters - minimum range, optimal range, maximum range. It is possible to attach to the weapon one or multiple upgrades that modify these three parameters. This test is to make sure that actual range of the weapon includes all upgrades attached to it.

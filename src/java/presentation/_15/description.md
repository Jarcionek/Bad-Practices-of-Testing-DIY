### Domain:

A large system has multiple applications available to access it - web interface, mobile app, stand alone installation etc. Each installation has an unique application id, which means that single user can be interacting with the system having one of a few different app ids. To make targeted promotions the marketing department wants to know how often users are using the system and what apps are most commonly used. `EventHandler` receives incoming user request (event), reports the activity and does some event processing (which is intentionally omitted in this code snippet).
